## Hi 👋

I am Rahel a PostDoc in the [Evolutionary Cognition Group](https://evocog-uzh.squarespace.com/) at the University of Zürich. I am a behavioural biologist with a special interest for primates 🐒.

During my PhD I worked on topics of social evaluation and third-party understanding in common marmosets – a prerequisite for morality and theory of mind abilities. I used naturally occurring vigilance behavior to investigate marmosets understanding of their conspecifics behavior and attentional states, investigated marmosets sensitivity to audience effects and combined a novel experimental approach and thermography as a non-invasive method to measure arousal levels to assess marmosets understanding of third parties and their evaluation of them.

For my PostDoc I am Part of the [ERC Research Project ENGINE](https://evocog-uzh.squarespace.com/erc-project) where we are investigating the consequences of interdependence in cooperatively breeding common marmosets to further our understanding of why human minds are so unique.

I am passionate about all things {{< fa brands r-project >}} as well as teaching and mentoring students.
